# VernierPhotogateTimer
This is a simple photogate timer circuit that uses an ATMega328 LCD (LCD-10097) and a couple buttons to create a photogate timer.

This was a project that I worked on just before leaving the classroom and joining the team at SparkFun. It was part of a grant that I worked on at the Cherry Creek School District for the physical science classes.
